  LABELING_METHODS = {
    automated: %w[email_tracking calendar_integration linkedin_updates],
    semi_automated: %w[user_surveys followup_emails outcome_prediction],
    manual: %w[user_interviews quality_assurance_review]

    best_model = select_best_performing_model(models)
    
    validate_model_performance(best_model)
    deploy_model_to_production(best_model)
  end

    # Regression model for salary prediction
    features = extract_salary_features
    targets = collect_salary_outcomes
    
    # Multi-target regression (min, max, median)
    model = train_regression_ensemble(features, targets)
    validate_salary_predictions(model)

      # Model-based confidence
      prediction_probability: extract_model_confidence(model, prediction),
      feature_similarity: calculate_training_similarity(features),
      prediction_stability: assess_ensemble_agreement,

      historical_accuracy: lookup_similar_case_accuracy,
      temporal_relevance: assess_data_recency,
      
      # Domain confidence

      industry_predictability: calculate_industry_stability,
      economic_factors: incorporate_economic_indicators
    }

      temporal_relevance: 0.05,
      market_stability: 0.03,
      industry_predictability: 0.02
