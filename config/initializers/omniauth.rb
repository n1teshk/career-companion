# Phase 3: Focusing on ML features first due to LinkedIn API approval complexity
#
# TODO: Implement LinkedIn integration after securing API approval:
# 1. Apply for LinkedIn Partner Program
# 2. Business justification for profile data access
# 3. Privacy policy and data handling documentation
# 4. Implement OAuth flow after approval

# For now, LinkedIn features will use mock data in development
